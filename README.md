# MiNap

## Description
Code and documentation for Mi Nap sleep diary smartwatch app and related infrastructure, developed by the 2023 ITS intern cohort at the University of Michigan. This Fitbit / Apple Watch / Garmin smartwatch app allows clinical research participants to keep a sleep diary on their watch, with the data being securely transferred to a staging cloud storage service, and then to an Oracle PL/SQL database that sits behind a firewall.
